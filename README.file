# Update 1 for March 7, 2022: So far, I have managed to read in the data correctly and process each student into a student object. Multiple student objects are added in the Class class. Next, I will start to build the algorithm in the Class class that actually sorts the students accordingly. 

# Update 2 for March 9, 2022: I was not in class, but I added more commits to the project from home. The updates that I made were that I gave the student class a toString method, did considerable amoung data processing to get the data into a usable shape for me to build my algorithms around. That data processing and toString are complete. Next, I will start implementing the sessions schdule, before doing the students, but I may want to create a algortihm that takes both session and student preferencess into account for opitmization purposes.
